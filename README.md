# openDerby
A self-contained LAN app for Pinewood Derby races.


This app will need the following:

- A frontend site to display the results of each heat, as well as any other times we need to display--winners per den, overall, etc.
- A server for the site/database, so that it is accessible on the LAN
- A database to hold the data as it comes in
- A Raspberry Pi to receive the data and host the app
